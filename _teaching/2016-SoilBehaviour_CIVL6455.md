This is an advanced soil mechanics course. It is concerned with the mechanical stress, strain, strength behaviour
and the application of this knowledge in geotechnical engineering. The course includes an introduction to critical
state soil mechanics, which is used to assist with the interpretation of soil data, and to enable prediction of ground
behaviour. The course uses the critical state framework to provide a firm basis for an understanding of the stress,
strain, strength behaviour of all soils, and to enable a rational approach to the selection of parameters for use in
geotechnical design.
